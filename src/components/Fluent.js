            After 15 years of experience working on behalf of various prestige
            car dealerships we have realised that dealerships are often experts
            in selling cars, but not necessarily in funding them. At Brocar
            finance arranging a tailored finance solution to meet your needs is
            our priority. We leave the car dealerships to supply the car, whilst
            we supply the finance package. We pride ourselves in an honest,
            clear and efficient service designed to source the best funding
            solution for your needs.

            Whilst many car buyers continue to fund their vehicle through their
            car dealership or bank, we work with some of the biggest lenders in
            the industry to offer competitive financial agreements and offer
            clients greater choice and flexibility.
