            After 15 years of experience working on behalf of various prestige
            brand dealerships we have realised that car dealerships are often
            experts in selling cars, but not necessarily in funding them. At
            Brocar finance arranging a tailored finance solution to meet your
            needs is our priority. We leave the car dealerships to supply the
            car, whilst we supply the finance package. We pride ourselves in an
            honest, clear and efficient service designed to source the best
            funding solution for your needs.
