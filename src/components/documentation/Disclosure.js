            The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is the independent regulator
            of financial services. The FCA requires us to provide you with a
            document called an 'Initial Disclosure Document'. This document
            provides information about us, the products we offer, the services
            we will provide, what we charge for our services, who regulates us,
            what to do if you have a complaint and details about the Financial
            Services Compensation Scheme.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h4>Whose products do we use?</h4>
          <p>
            As an FCA regulated credit broker we can introduce you to a limited
            number of lenders who may be able to finance your purchase of a
            vehicle. We will only introduce you to these lenders.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h4>Do we charge for our services?</h4>
          <p>
            We are a commission and fee based organisation which means that we
            may receive a payment(s) or other benefits from finance providers
            should you decide to enter into an agreement with us. These fees may
            be variable or pre-set dependent on the product and the volume that
            we place with the chosen supplier.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h4>Commission disclosure</h4>
          <p>
            The Financial Conduct Authority expects any intermediary to disclose
            to the customer that a commission may be payable by the owner or
            creditor to the intermediary, and, if the customer asks, the amount
            of that commission. The Financial Conduct Authority has made it
            clear that “commission” means any financial consideration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The existence and nature of Commission arrangements where the
            Commission varies depending on the Lender, product or other
            permissible factors will always be disclosed.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you would like us to disclose any potential commission please
            make your request to our head office address on our contact page or
            by email to enquiries@brocarfinance.co.uk or by telephone on
            01908032694
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h4>Other Finance Facilities</h4>
          <p>
            You may be able to obtain finance for your purchase from other
            lenders and you are encouraged to seek alternative quotations and
            details of their products by researching on the high street, in the
            media and online.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h4>Treating Customers Fairly</h4>
          <p>
            Our business is committed to treating our customers fairly and
            ensuring our products and services are suitable for their needs.
            Treating Customers Fairly (TCF) is a core part of our culture and
            philosophy and you can review our commitment to it by asking for a
            copy of our TCF policy statement.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h4>Who regulates us?</h4>
          <p>
            We are a credit broker and not a lender. We are authorised and
            regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Our firm’s reference
            number is 944254 You can verify this on the FCA's Register by
            visiting the FCA's website: http://www.fca.org.uk/register... or by
            contacting them on 0800 111 6768.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other services we offer are not regulated by the FCA however the
            Financial Ombudsman Services has now been extended to handle some
            complaints under the Consumer Credit Act.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h4>Affordability </h4>
          <p>
            You should assess the monthly payments you are required to make
            throughout the agreement and ensure you are able to meet these
            obligations and other obligations you already have without suffering
            undue hardship. If you are aware of any future events that will
            affect your ability to meet these payments, you should ensure the
            provider is informed immediately. Your credit rating could be
            adversely affected if you do not make payments when due which could
            make it harder or more expensive for you to access finance
            facilities in the future.
          </p>
          <br></br>

            raise a complaint it is important to us that these are dealt with
            objectively, fairly and within an acceptable time frame.
          </p>
          <p>

          <br></br>
          <h4>Investigation</h4>
          <p>
            The Customer Resolutions Department will work with the relevant
            department managers to establish the nature and scope of your
            complaint having due regards to the Financial Conduct Authority's
            direction:
          </p>
          <ul>

          <br></br>
          <h4>Eligibility</h4>
          <p>
            It is our policy to treat all complainants the same, however,
            certain types of complaints fall within the scope of FCA rules and
            consequently within the jurisdiction of the Financial Ombudsman
            Service.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h4>FCA Complaints Rules</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Complaints made by, or on behalf of an eligible complainant;
              Eligible Complainants are essentially individuals and certain
              small businesses
            </li>
            <li>
              The Complainant must relate to the provision of or failure to
              provide a financial service or a redress determination and;
            </li>
            <li>
              The Complainant must allege that they have suffered, or may
              suffer, financial loss, material distress or material
              inconvenience

          </ul>
          <br></br>
          <h4>Final Response</h4>
          <p>
            This will set out clearly our decision re the complaint and the
            reasons for it. If any compensation is offered a clear method of
            calculation will be shown.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where appropriate we are required to include details of the
            Financial Ombudsman Service in the final response. If dealing with
            an eligible complainant and a regulated activity, we will:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Explain that the complainant must refer the matter to the
              Ombudsman within six months of the date of this letter or the
              right to use this service is lost
            </li>
            <li>
              Indicate whether we consent to waive the relevant time limits.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br></br>
          <h4>Complaints settled within 3 business days</h4>
          <p>
            Complaints that can be settled to your satisfaction within 3
            business days can be recorded and communicated differently. Where we
            consider a complaint to be resolved to your satisfaction under this
            section, we will promptly send you a Summary Resolution
            Communication, being a written communication from us which:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Refers to the fact that you have made a complaint and informs you
              that we now consider the complaint to have been resolved to your
              satisfaction;
            </li>
            <li>
              We will tell you that if you subsequently decide that you are
              dissatisfied with the resolution of the complaint you may be able
              to refer the complaint back to us for further consideration or
              alternatively refer the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman
              Service.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              Indicates if we consent to waive the relevant time limits, (where
              we have discretion in such matters){" "}
            </li>

              the Financial Ombudsman Service.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4 className="mt-4">Closing a complaint</h4>
          <p>
            We will consider a complaint closed when we have made our final
            response to you. This does not prevent you from exercising any
            rights you may have to refer the matter to the Financial Ombudsman
            Service.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h4>What to do if you are not happy with our decision</h4>
          <p>
            If you have a regulated consumer credit contract arranged by us and
            are not satisfied with our Final Response, you may be eligible to
            refer the matter to the Financial Ombudsman.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h4>Financial Ombudsman Service</h4>
          <p>
            If relevant then you can refer your complaint to the Financial
            Ombudsman Service – you must do this within six months of our final
            response. When we send you a final response, we will also provide
            you with a copy of the Financial Ombudsman Service’s explanatory
            leaflet.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will co-operate fully with the Ombudsman in resolving any
            complaints made against us and agree to be bound by any awards made
            by them.
