                  Personal Contract Purchase, commonly referred to as PCP, can
                  be best described as a long term rental where customers can
                  use their vehicle until the end of their agreement before
                  deciding whether they want to keep their vehicle or not.

                  <br></br> The flexibility, lower monthly payments and
                  guaranteed minimum future values are all reasons why this is

                  At the end of the agreement there are three options for you to
                  choose from. Pay the GMFV (including any option to purchase
                  fee) and take ownership of the vehicle. Hand back the vehicle
                  subject to condition and mileage. Part exchange the vehicle
                  for another one, where you can use any equity you may have
                  along with a deposit if required. You should also be aware
                  that you could have to cover any shortfall.

                  Hire purchase has been a very popular way for customers to
                  fund the purchase of their vehicles.

                  <br></br>
                  Hire purchase is a fixed cost loan secured onto the vehicle.
                  You will usually pay a cash deposit, part exchange a vehicle
                  or both and make monthly payments typically between a 24 or 60
                  month term.

                  <br></br>
                  At the end of the term you will pay a small option to purchase
                  fee and the ownership of the vehicle is now yours. <br></br>

                  The cost of living crisis has played its part in the increased

                  to keep your car, hoping to reduce your monthly outgoings or

                  agreement and settling any finance you may currently have,

                  of finance.

                  Lease Purchase is often compared to Hire Purchase, the main
                  difference between the two agreements is that Lease Purchase
                  agreements have a balloon payment. This can make it a
                  preferred method of funding to customers where their priority
                  is keeping their monthly payment low.

                  The finance company will use information you provide such as
                  the term you would like the finance over and what mileage you
                  plan to do on the vehicle to set a balloon payment based on
                  the expected value of the car at the end of the term. You can
                  then make a lump sum payment to clear the balloon payment and
                  keep the car or use the vehicle as part exchange against
                  another.
